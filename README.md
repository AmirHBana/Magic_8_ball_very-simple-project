<h2> Magic 8 Ball </h2>

<hr>


<br><br>

<p>The Magic 8 Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized eight ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel.[1] The user asks a yes–no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer that floats up into a window.</p>
